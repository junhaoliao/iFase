It is widely agreed that students gain more confidence and build stronger relationships when instructors know their names. However, it is often difficult for the instructors to recognize and remember all the names of the students while the lecture size is relatively large.
To solve this problem, the team is proposing an application that helps the meeting participants to tell othersâ€™ names during the in-person meeting activities. The application will capture faces from videos/pictures through a User Interface that operates on web browsers and passes the data to a face recognition AI mechanism. User management systems will also be implemented to protect user privacy. With the Real-time Face Recognition Application, the team believes that instructors(users) will be able to quickly recognize and obtain basic information about their students.
